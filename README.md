# Diplomacy

Diplomacy is a board game. This is the Diplomacy board game rule set I wrote in
2003/2004 at UNSW because I liked playing board games and coding Ruby and had a
lot of spare time.

The code is a bit basic because I had only just learned Ruby.

I doubt this code passes DATC but it might still be of interest to somebody out
there.
